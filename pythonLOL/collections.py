### Collections
# There are four built-in collection-types, (there are more but these are the ones u use)

### list
# python don't really use arrays, instead everything is just lists. can be compared to arraylists, same syntax as Java arrays, square brackets

names = ["Henrik", "Erik", "Niklas", "Sofia"]
my_mixed_list = [True, 10, "Niklas"]

### Tuple - ordered collection and unchangeable. 
my_color_tuple = ("Blue", "Red", "Green", "Yellow")

### Set
my_suits = {"hearts", "Spades", "diamonds", 10}

### Dictionaries
person = {
    "name": "Erik",
    "age": 28,
    "height": 188
}
#to access value use square brackets and key
print(person["name"])
